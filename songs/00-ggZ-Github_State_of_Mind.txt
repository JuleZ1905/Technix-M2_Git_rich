Yeah, yeah
Ayo, teachers, it's time.
It's time, teachers (aight, teachers, begin).
Straight out the sexy dungeons of rap.

The control drops deep as does my version.
I never scan, 'cause to scan is the buddy of immersion.
Beyond the walls of trees, life is defined.
I think of food when I'm in a github state of mind.

Hope the soul got some roll.
My bowl don't like no dirty pole.
Run up to the hole and get the console.

In a github state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The complex control?
You complain about git.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the soul.

I'm rappin' to the overlay,
And I'm gonna move your day.

Fast, great, blind, like a system
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a telesystem.

I can't take the git, can't take the majority.
I woulda tried to drink I guess I got no sorority.

I'm rappin' to the day,
And I'm gonna move your overlay.

Yea, yaz, in a github state of mind.

When I was young my buddy had an excursion.
I waz kicked out without no aversion.
I never thought I'd see that conversion.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my buddy's immersion.

A hyped display is quite the way.

Thinking of food. Yaz, thinking of food (food).
