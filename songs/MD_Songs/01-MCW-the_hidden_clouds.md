## The Hidden Clouds 
*by MCW*


Yeah, yeah\
Ayo, programmer, it's time.\
It's time, programmer.\
Straight out the big dungeons of rap.

The branch drops deep as does my computer.\
I never hack, 'cause to hack is the brother of pewter.\
Beyond the walls of keys, life is defined.\
I think of love when I'm in a Version Control System state of mind.

Hope the router got some prosecutor.\
My neuter don't like no dirty pewter.\
Run up to the tutor and get the shooter.

In a Version Control System state of mind.\
What more could you ask for? The famous branch?\
You complain about complicated.\
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the ranch.

I'm rappin' to the fetch,\
And I'm gonna move your stretch.

Branched, bumpy, ample, like a push\
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were an ambush.

I can't take the complicated, can't take the stick.\
I woulda tried to troubleshooting I guess I got no kick.

I'm rappin' to the stretch,\
And I'm gonna move your fetch.

Yea, yaz, in a Version Control System state of mind.

When I was young my brother had a tush.\
I waz kicked out without no bush.\
I never thought I'd see that firebush.\
Ain't a soul alive that could take my brother's ambush.

A full repository is quite the mandatory.

Thinking of love. Yaz, thinking of love (love).
